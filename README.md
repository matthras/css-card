# A Simple Card Element

Just practising furnishing my own design on a simple card element.

**Backstory [15/10/2017]:** - I've not been coding for three months due to work sucking up all my spare time. On /r/webdev I came across [Tania Rascia's 'Design for Developers'](https://www.taniarascia.com/design-for-developers/) post and as someone who falls into that intended audience I saw it as a chance to get back into the groove of things.

I've also been a bit out of touch lately with CSS, Flexbox and such, so building this was an opportunity to explore these new features.
